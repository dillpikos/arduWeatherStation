# Portable arduWeatherStation
A portable embedded system project made using Arduino Nano, sensors, and TFT color display
- created by Bryan Diaz



# Project Overview


Portable weather station prototype made using Arduino Nano along with
- MQ-135 air quality sensor
- DHT-11 tempature and humidity sensor
- DS3231 real time clock module
- ST7735 1.44" tft lcd display (operates using SPI)

Weather station displays, current Time (AM/PM), day of the week, the current date in (month/day/year) format along with
tempature in both degrees farenheit and celcius. Also includes humidity and airquality readings with
time cordinated icons.

Has a switch that can change the theme of the weather station to better suit the enviorment of the user
switch facing left = light/day theme; switch facing right = dark/night theme
